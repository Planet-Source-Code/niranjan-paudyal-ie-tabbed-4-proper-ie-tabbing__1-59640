Please compile the program before running!
I warn in advance, please compile before running!

When you run the program, it will not show itself unless there are IE windows open.
Otherwise, launch an IE window and it will be tabbed.

Enjoy.


Updates since last post.
Much more stable.
Right click menu.
Can autorun on start up.
Tabs close with middle button.
Doesnt use any extra controls for subclassing.
Several other features*---cant remember them!


This program tabbs internet explorers windows, providing you with an excellent tabbed interface that doesn't compramise IE functionalities. This is the first program of its type.
